# Multimedia_retrieval

To run the web-based application, run the code in "interface.py". Running it will automatically open a browser, 
displaying the system. 

Unfortunately, we encountered a bug quite late which we were unable to patch before handing in the assignment. This bug 
makes the visualisation button work only once. This means you can only visualize one mesh of the results. If you want 
to visualize another mesh, one must restart the application, query the same mesh, and then visualize another mesh. Since
 this is highly impractical, we quickly implemented a way to easily visualize a mesh in a textual interface as well. 
To use this, simply run the "visualize_mesh.py" file and enter the path of the mesh you would like to visualize. Since 
it is possible to run the interface and "visualize_mesh" at the same time, one can also simple copy the paths from the 
graphical interface into the textual interface if one wants to visualize multiple meshes.
